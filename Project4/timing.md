## Timing
Timing convention used in this demonstration are as follows: 
+ Each dot/dash is followed by a gap equal to 1 dot duration. 
+ A dash is the length of 3 dots.
+ The gap between characters of a word is equal to 3 dots.
+ Two words are separated by a gap equal to 7 dots.

**To avoid ambiguity each dot is set to 50ms.**
The time interval to regenerate the message is set to 7 dots, equal to the time interval between words.
